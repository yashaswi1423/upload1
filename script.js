Inspired by AIMultiple’s description of agentic RAG, where an AI agent autonomously routes queries to appropriate databases and self‑corrects, teams should build a multi‑agent system that accepts natural‑language questions from planners (e.g., “Which warehouse should ship March orders to our eastern region to minimise cost and meet service‑level agreements?”). 
    The system must:
•	Use a routing agent to decide which data sources to query (inventory DB, ERP orders table, shipping‑cost API, etc.), generate appropriate SQL/API calls and retrieve the data. The agent should perform multiple function calls and refine its approach if initial results are insufficient.
•	Coordinate with a reasoning agent to compute optimal decisions—such as order–warehouse assignments or route schedules—and provide interpretable explanations.
•	Present a concise report showing the data sources used, the reasoning steps and the final recommendation.
This task demonstrates how agentic RAG can enable autonomous, multi‑turn information retrieval and decision‑making in supply‑chain management.`

Background:
In IT companies, thousands of employees access emails, cloud apps, code repositories, and sensitive client data daily. While firewalls and antivirus protect against outsiders, some of the biggest risks come from inside — like an employee accidentally uploading data to public drives, sharing passwords, or using personal USB devices.

The Challenge:
Design a simple solution to detect and alert when there is a potential insider threat.

Your solution should:
•\tMonitor basic activities such as unusual file uploads, bulk downloads, or logins from unexpected locations.
•\tShow real-time alerts like “Large data download detected from HR folder at 2 AM.”
•\tKeep employee privacy protected (avoid storing personal details unnecessarily).
•\tProvide a clean dashboard with a simple risk score: Low / Medium / High. [a simple dashboard/web page]
•\tSimulate 3–4 basic anomalies: like login at odd hours, large file download, or multiple failed login attempts.
•\tBuild a basic rule-based detector (no need for advanced ML).

Bonus:
•\tAdd a feature to suggest quick actions: “Suspend suspicious session” or “Notify IT Security.”
•\tShow how the tool scales for a company with 1,000+ employees.

The assistant should: 
1. Ask probing questions instead of revealing answers directly 
2. Adapt follow-up questions based on student responses 
3. Guide students to discover answers through their own reasoning 
4. Maintain focus on sorting algorithms 
5. Handle the computational complexity efficiently 
Target Topic: Data Structures and Algorithms - Sorting Algorithms 
This topic is chosen because it is fundamental to computer science education, familiar to most software engineering students, and well-defined in scope, making it ideal for a focused prototype. 
Example 1: Time Complexity Query 
Student Question: "What is the time complexity of bubble sort?" 
Traditional Approach (NOT what we want): "The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n²)." 
Socratic Approach (What your solution should do): 
Step 1: "Let's think about how each algorithm works. Can you describe how merge sort divides the problem?" 
Step 2: "Good! Now, how does that division strategy affect the number of operations needed?" 
Step 3: "Now compare that with bubble sort - how many comparisons does it make for an array of size n?" 
Step 4: Guide the student to compare O(n log n) vs O(n²) on their own 
Example 2: When/Why to Use an Algorithm 
Student Question: "When should I use quick sort?" 
Traditional Approach (NOT what we want): "Quick sort is good for large datasets and has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but worst case is O(n²) when the pivot is poorly chosen." 
Socratic Approach (What your solution should do): 
Step 1: "What factors do you think are important when choosing a sorting algorithm for a project?" 
Step 2: "Interesting! How do you think quick sort performs on average compared to its worst case?" 
Step 3: "What might cause quick sort to hit its worst-case scenario?" 
Step 4: "Given what you've discovered, in what situations would quick sort be a good choice?" 
Example 3: Implementation Details 
Student Question: "How does merge sort work?" 
Traditional Approach (NOT what we want): "Merge sort divides the array into halves recursively until single elements remain, then merges them back in sorted order." 
Socratic Approach (What your solution should do): 
Step 1: "Have you heard of the divide-and-conquer strategy in algorithms?" 
Step 2: "How do you think we could apply that strategy to sorting?" 
Step 3: "If we keep dividing an array in half, what's the smallest piece we can get?" 
Step 4: "Great! Now, if you have two sorted arrays, how would you combine them into one sorted array?" 
Step 5: Guide the student to piece together the full merge sort process 
Example 4: Handling Incorrect Answers 
Student Question: "Is bubble sort O(n) time complexity?" 
Traditional Approach (NOT what we want): "No, that's incorrect. Bubble sort is O(n²)." 
Socratic Approach (What your solution should do): 
Step 1: "Let's think about this together. In bubble sort, how many times do we need to pass through the array?" 
Step 2: "And in each pass, how many comparisons might we make?" 
Step 3: "So if we have n elements, and we make up to n passes, with up to n comparisons each pass, what does that tell us?" 
Step 4: "Right! So would you like to reconsider your answer about the time complexity?" 
FINAL NOTE 
Remember: The goal is not just to build an AI that knows the answers, but one that teaches students how to find them. Your assistant should make students think, not just provide information.`

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots constantly front-run regular users by inserting transactions with higher gas fees, exploiting DeFi traders and NFT buyers. This leads to slippage, unfair trades, and financial losses for everyday users.
Build a middleware DApp or dashboard that:
1.\tDetects suspicious mempool behavior, including sandwich attacks, front-running, and other MEV patterns.
2.\tShows flagged transactions, affected users, and potential slippage losses in real-time.
3.\tOptionally integrates a private transaction relayer (e.g., Flashbots) to allow users to submit transactions safely.
4.\tBonus: Includes a simulation mode where users can test transactions before submitting to predict front-running risks.
Evaluation Criteria:
Metric\tDescription\tEvaluation Criteria
Detection\nAccuracy\tHow well the system identifies front-running / sandwich attacks in the mempool\t% of correctly flagged malicious transactions vs. total simulated attacks
User Impact\nAwareness\tClarity of information about affected users and potential losses\tQuality of dashboard visualization, ease of understanding, actionable insights
Real-Time\nPerformance\tSpeed at which transactions are analyzed and flagged\tTime from transaction broadcast → detection (< few seconds ideal)`
